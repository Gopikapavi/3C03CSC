    <h3>DISASTERS IN THE WORLD </h3>
     Disaster is a serious problem occurring
     over a short or long period of time that causes
     widespread human, material, economic or
     environmental loss which exceeds the ability
     of the affected community or society to cope
     using its own resources.
               Natural disasters are caused due to different
      reasons like soil erosion, seismic activity, tectonic
      movements, air pressure, and ocean currents etc.
                 There are two types of disaster: natural
      and man-made. ... Natural Disaster: A disaster
      caused by natural factors called as a natural
      disaster e.g., earthquake, flood, cyclone etc.
       2. Man-made disaster: A disaster caused due to the
       human activities e.g., wars, fire accidents, industrial accidents

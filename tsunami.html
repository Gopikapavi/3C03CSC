       <h1><i><b><u>Tsunami effects </i></b></u>  </h1>
         Most tsunami damage and destruction is caused by 
         flooding, wave impacts, erosion, strong currents, 
         and floating debris (e.g., trees, structures,
        vehicles, and other things that can act like battering 
        rams). The water can be just as dangerous, if not more 
        so, as it returns to the sea, taking debris and 
        people with it.

       <h1><i><b><u>Cyclone effects </i></b></u>  </h1>
         The effects of tropical cyclones include heavy rain, 
         strong wind, large storm surges near landfall, 
         and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical
         cyclone, such as a hurricane or tropical storm,
          depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and 
          its location.
